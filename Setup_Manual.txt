How to set up Natural Gas IoT:

This instruction is for setting up a Raspberry Pi Zero W without a monitor or keyboard!! 

1. Download the OS (Raspbian_Lite):
	https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
	
2. Download SD card tool to write OS image into SD card:
	https://etcher.io/
	
3. Flash the OS downloaded from step 1 using tool downloaded in step 2 into your SD card.

4. Enable SSH by creating a file with the name of "ssh" with nothing in the file (Note: without any extensions)

5. Copy the "ssh" file into "boot" drive.

6. Enable Wifi by creating a file called "wpa_supplicant.conf" put the following content in the file:

	country=US
	ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
	update_config=1

	network={
	 ssid="WIFI_SSID"
	 scan_ssid=1
	 psk="WIFI_PASSWORD"
	 key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
	}
	
7. Copy the "wpa_supplicant.conf" file into boot.

8. Download Putty for SSH:
	http://www.putty.org/
	
9. Download a IP scanner to find the raspberry pi on your local network
	http://angryip.org/download/#windows
	
10. Insert the SD card created from previous steps and connect the Raspberry Pi to power, wait for 30 to 60 seconds for it to connect to wifi.

11. Use the IP scanner downloaded from step 9 to look for the IP address of the RPi.

12. After finding the IP address, use Putty to SSH into the system. (Default username: pi, password: raspberry)

13. Change your password by using "sudo passwd" command.

14. Run the following commands to update the Pi:
	1. sudo apt-get update
	2. sudo apt-get upgrade
	
15. Install git by running the following command:
	sudo apt-get install git
	
16. Clone the repository by running the following command:
	git clone https://github.com/DylanYue/NaturalGasMonitor.git

17. Install python dateutil package by running:
	git apt-get install python-dateutil

18. Install Adafruit libraries by running: (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_GPIO)
	1. sudo apt-get install build-essential python-pip python-dev python-smbus python-imaging
	2. git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_GPIO.git
	3. cd Adafruit_Python_GPIO
	4. sudo python setup.py install
	5. cd ~
	
19. Install SSD1306 (OLED) libraries
	1. git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_SSD1306.git
	2. cd Adafruit_Python_SSD1306
	3. sudo python setup.py install
	4. cd ~
	
20. Install MCP3008 (ADC chip) libraries:
	sudo pip install adafruit-mcp3008
	
21. Enable I2C by:
	1. sudo raspi-config
	2. go to "interfacing options"
	3. go to "I2C"
	4. Enable.
	
22. Check to make sure the system can find the OLED I2C by running:
	sudo i2cdetect -y 1
	find a device "3c" in the list
	
23. Reboot the Pi:
	sudo reboot

24. Run the main program:
	1. cd NaturalGasMonitor
	2. python main.py
